Sistem Informasi Peminjaman Ruangan Kampus (SiManuk) is a real-time website-based application. SiManuk provides room availability as well as other detailed information about the rooms being and will be provided in a building. The target users of SiManuk are internal (lecturers and students) and external (guests/guests).
SiManuk was created with the aim of knowing what rooms are being and will be used on the schedule provided on that day. In addition, SiManuk also helps new students or guests from outside the campus who do not even know the location of a room in the building. Information such as the person in charge of borrowing a room, the room used, the intended use of the room, the original schedule of the room, and the length of time the room can be viewed can also be viewed through the application. Of course, this makes it easier for the accessors so they don't have to check any particular room.
Our reason for developing this project is because there are no similar projects that have been or are being developed in the FPMIPA-C UPI building.
